# Cryptocurrencies

## Purpose

The purpose of this project was to create an analysis for our clients who are preparing to get into the cryptocurrency market.  A prominent investment bank is interested in offering a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio for its customers.  We have been asked to create a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment.  We will be using unsupervised learning since there is no known output for what Martha is looking for.  We will then use data visualizations to share our findings with the board.
